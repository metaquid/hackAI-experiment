## the Nvidia AI Workbench Quick Start Guide
Nvidia AI Workbench is a platform with all the tools you need to develop, train, and deploy artificial intelligence (AI) models, leveraging the power of Nvidia GPUs.

## Benefits
All-in-one: Integrated tools for AI and machine learning.
GPU optimization: Leverage Nvidia GPUs for fast computation.
Collaboration: Easily share models.
Scalability: Deploy to cloud or on-premises infrastructure.

## Introduction
Prerequisites: Basic knowledge of Python and machine learning.
Installation: Install Docker, Nvidia Docker, download AI Workbench, and set up your environment.

## Features
Code editor: Develop with Jupyter Notebook.
Dataset management: Preprocess and load data.
Monitoring: Monitor model performance in real time.

## Training and deployment
Training: Define and train models on GPUs with TensorFlow or PyTorch.
Deployment: Export and run your model on cloud or on-premises.

## Simulation
If you don't have a powerful GPU, AI Workbench offers simulated modes and access to cloud GPUs.

## Tips
To simulate using the GPU without any available hardware, you can set up a CPU-only version of the container

docker run -p 8888:8888 -v /path/to/your/code:/workspace -it nvidia/ai-workbench:cpu
